Context and Details for Makefile Enhancement

BACKGROUND:
User requested 'gmake run-clojure', 'gmake run-python', and 'gmake test' targets.
The existing Makefile only had org-mode tangle/detangle operations.

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. Initial Clojure implementation failed due to complex dependency chain issues
2. deps.edn contained problematic dependencies (scicloj:notespace, dtype-next)
3. Namespace loading issues with require vs load-file approaches
4. Shell escaping problems with -Sdeps parameter in Makefile

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added .PHONY declarations for new targets
2. Implemented run-clojure using direct file loading approach
3. Implemented run-python using module execution
4. Added comprehensive test targets (test, test-clojure, test-python)
5. Added smoke-test target for basic functionality verification
6. Updated help text to document all new targets

EXPERIMENTS:
1. Tried multiple approaches for Clojure namespace loading:
   - require with classpath manipulation: Failed due to deps.edn
   - -Sdeps parameter: Failed due to shell escaping
   - load-file approach: SUCCESS - bypasses dependency issues

2. Tested various classpath configurations:
   - Global deps.edn caused issues
   - Directory-specific execution worked
   - Direct file loading proved most reliable

DEVIATIONS:
- Originally planned to use standard 'require' approach for Clojure
- Had to fallback to load-file method due to dependency conflicts
- This is acceptable for development but may need refinement for production

FOLLOW-UP:
- Clojure dependencies need cleanup for full require-based loading
- Test directories need to be created with actual test files
- Consider adding lint and typecheck targets as mentioned in project guidelines

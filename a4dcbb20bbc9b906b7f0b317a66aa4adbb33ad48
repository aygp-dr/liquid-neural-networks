Context and Details for Applications Documentation

BACKGROUND:
User requested comprehensive high-level application examples in org mode covering:
- Autonomous Systems (drone navigation, self-driving cars, robotics)
- Time-Series Analysis (financial, weather, sensor data)
- Medical Diagnostics (ECG, brain signals, disease progression)
- Edge AI (IoT, embedded systems, anomaly detection)

The user specifically wanted language-agnostic documentation that could work for both Python and Clojure implementations.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created APPLICATIONS.org with detailed scaffolding for all requested domains
2. Each application includes: overview, key features, technical approach, use cases, implementation considerations
3. Structured with proper org-mode formatting and table of contents
4. Added specific neuron allocation recommendations for each application
5. Included performance requirements and regulatory considerations

TESTING:
- Verified org-mode formatting renders correctly
- Checked all internal links and structure
- Confirmed language-agnostic approach throughout

EXPERIMENTS:
Based on previous exploration of the LNN research literature and the existing project structure, particularly the claims about 19-neuron drone navigation and 302-neuron time-series analysis.

DEVIATIONS:
None - implemented exactly as requested by user.

FOLLOW-UP:
- Applications documentation provides foundation for future implementation work
- Each section can be expanded with specific code examples later
- Integration points identified for both Python and Clojure implementations

Context and Details for Source File Implementation

BACKGROUND:
Generated comprehensive source files through org-mode tangling from SETUP.org.
Created both basic and research-level implementations in Python and Clojure.

CHANGES MADE:
1. src/clojure/liquid_neural_networks/core.clj - Full LTC neuron implementation
2. src/clojure/liquid_neural_networks/applications.clj - Application-specific code
3. src/python/lnn_research.py - Research framework with JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow
4. src/python/lnn_visualization.py - Visualization and analysis tools

TECHNICAL FEATURES:
- Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) neurons with adaptive time constants
- Continuous-time dynamics using ODEs
- Multiple activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, swish, gelu, etc.)
- JAX-based implementation for high performance
- PyTorch and TensorFlow backends for compatibility
- Comprehensive benchmarking and analysis tools

EXPERIMENTS:
Generated from literate programming approach in SETUP.org allowing:
- Single source of truth for documentation and code
- Consistent implementation across languages
- Reproducible research framework

DEVIATIONS:
- Some advanced features (like tablecloth integration) disabled due to dependency issues
- Focused on core LNN functionality rather than full ecosystem integration

FOLLOW-UP:
- These implementations provide foundation for all applications in APPLICATIONS.org
- Ready for experimentation with 19-neuron drone navigation and similar tasks
- Can be extended with specific application code as needed

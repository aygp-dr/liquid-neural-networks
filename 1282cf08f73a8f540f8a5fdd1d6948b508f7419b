Context and Details for Dependency Management

BACKGROUND:
Complex Clojure dependency chain was preventing basic functionality.
Multiple scientific computing libraries had unresolvable version conflicts.

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. scicloj:notespace:jar:4.0.0-beta7 not found in central repository
2. scicloj:dtype-next:jar:10.104.0 missing from central
3. Circular dependency issues with tablecloth -> dtype-next chain
4. Matrix computation libraries (core.matrix, vectorz-clj) also problematic
5. Scientific computing stack (fastmath, tech.ml) dependent on broken chain

CHANGES MADE:
1. Commented out scicloj/notespace (visualization dependency)
2. Commented out scicloj/dtype-next and dependent libraries
3. Commented out scicloj/tablecloth and tech.ml
4. Temporarily disabled matrix computation libraries
5. Kept core Clojure libraries and basic functionality
6. Added explanatory comments for each disabled dependency

EXPERIMENTS:
1. Tried selective dependency removal - still failed
2. Attempted version downgrades - repositories missing entirely
3. Complete removal of scicloj ecosystem - SUCCESS

HYPOTHESIS:
The scicloj ecosystem appears to be in transition or has repository issues.
For basic LNN development, we can start with core Clojure and add dependencies incrementally.

DEVIATIONS:
- Originally intended to have full scientific computing stack
- Had to fall back to minimal viable dependency set
- This enables development to proceed while dependency issues are resolved

FOLLOW-UP:
- Research current scicloj ecosystem status
- Consider alternative matrix/scientific libraries (Neanderthal, etc.)
- Re-enable dependencies once repository issues are resolved
- May need to switch to different Clojure ML ecosystem

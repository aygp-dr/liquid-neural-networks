Context and Details for UV Integration

BACKGROUND:
User pointed out that raw pip install is inefficient and we should use uv.
UV is a fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. pip install was slow, especially for packages requiring compilation
2. Traditional pip workflows are inefficient for development
3. CI/CD could benefit from faster dependency resolution

CHANGES MADE:
1. Updated Makefile deps target to use 'uv pip install'
2. Updated install target to use 'uv pip install -e .'
3. Modified GitHub Actions CI to install uv first
4. Updated all three CI jobs to use uv consistently

BENEFITS:
- Significantly faster dependency resolution and installation
- Better caching and parallel downloads
- More reliable dependency solving
- Modern Python tooling approach

EXPERIMENTS:
Testing showed uv still needs to compile scipy on FreeBSD, but resolution is much faster.
This is a platform limitation, not a uv issue.

DEVIATIONS:
None - this is a pure improvement over traditional pip workflow.

FOLLOW-UP:
- Consider adding uv.lock file for deterministic builds
- May want to explore uv's virtual environment management
- CI should be much faster with uv

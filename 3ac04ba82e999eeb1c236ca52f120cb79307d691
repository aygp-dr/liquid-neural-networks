## Repository Rebuild Instructions

1. Clone repository at v0.1.0 tag: `git clone --branch v0.1.0 <repo-url>`
2. Project foundation is established but no LNN implementation yet

## Architecture Decisions

- Used semantic versioning starting at v0.1.0
- Marked as pre-release to indicate draft status
- Documented known issues transparently
- Set clear expectations about project maturity
- Provided roadmap in release notes for transparency

## Development Process

This initial release captures the project setup phase where:
- Two AI agents collaborated on the initial structure
- One agent created COMPREHENSIVE.org with extensive setup
- Second agent cleaned up and made it production-ready
- Build artifacts were preserved as documentation
- Clear separation between developer docs (SETUP.org) and user docs (README.org)

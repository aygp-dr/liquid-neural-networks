Context and Details for CI/CD and Dependency Management

BACKGROUND:
User requested verification that GitHub Actions work and that 'gmake deps' is sane.
Discovered no existing CI and dependency management issues.

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. No existing GitHub Actions workflows
2. requirements.txt contained heavy ML dependencies not available on FreeBSD
3. PyTorch, TensorFlow compilation failed on FreeBSD
4. Missing gmake deps target

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created .github/workflows/ci.yml with comprehensive CI pipeline
2. Added requirements-minimal.txt with platform-compatible dependencies
3. Added 'deps' and 'install' targets to Makefile
4. Updated help text to document new targets

CI PIPELINE FEATURES:
- Matrix testing across Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Separate jobs for Python and Clojure testing
- Lint checks with ruff and black
- Smoke tests to verify basic functionality
- Platform compatibility (Ubuntu for CI)

DEPENDENCY STRATEGY:
- Minimal requirements for core functionality
- Optional heavy dependencies commented out
- Platform-aware dependency management
- Graceful failure handling for missing dependencies

EXPERIMENTS:
1. Tested scipy installation - too slow on FreeBSD (compilation required)
2. Verified core functionality works with minimal dependencies
3. CI pipeline designed to catch basic issues without heavy dependencies

FOLLOW-UP:
- CI will run on next push to verify functionality
- Consider adding badges to README
- May need platform-specific requirements files for different deployment targets

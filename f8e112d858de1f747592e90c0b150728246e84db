## Prompts Used

1. Update COMPREHENSIVE.org so it won't tangle to root filesystem
   - Intent: Prevent accidental system file modifications during tangling
   - Action: Convert all absolute paths to relative project paths

2. Fix formatting issues while keeping corruption artifact
   - Intent: Make file usable while preserving build process artifact for later fix
   - Action: Added proper org-mode headers, closed unclosed blocks, marked corruption

## Testing Notes

### Tangle Safety
- All tangle directives now use relative paths
- System config examples use :tangle config/sysctl.conf.example with :mkdirp yes
- No risk of writing to /etc or other system directories

### File Structure
- Added proper #+TITLE, #+AUTHOR, #+DATE headers
- Set consistent header-args properties for tangling
- Closed the unclosed #+BEGIN_SRC block at line 2364
- Added comment noting corruption artifact for future cleanup

## Repository Rebuild Instructions

1. The corruption artifact at end of file is intentional - part of build process
2. When tangling COMPREHENSIVE.org, ensure mkdirp is supported
3. All tangled files will be created relative to project root
4. System configurations are examples only - manual copy required for actual use

## Architecture Decisions

- Used org-mode source blocks for all configuration files
- Leveraged :mkdirp yes to auto-create directories
- Kept all tangle targets within project directory structure
- Preserved build artifact as documentation of process issues
